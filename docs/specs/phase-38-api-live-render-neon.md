# Phase 38 — API live on Render + Neon

## Goal

Take the production-ready backend built in Phase 37 and actually run it: a live
Django API on Render (free tier, native Python runtime) talking to a live Neon
Postgres over SSL, reachable over HTTPS at `https://<service>.onrender.com`.
The database is bootstrapped **from this laptop** — Render's free tier has no
shell — with `migrate`, one real superuser/instructor, and `populate_java_course`
for JAVA101. Verification goes past `curl`: the local Vite dev server is pointed
at the live API and a real login + JAVA101 browse is clicked through, which also
de-risks Phase 39's CORS work. The only repo changes are three small edits to
`render.yaml`; everything else is dashboard configuration and one-off commands.

## Interview decisions (2026-07-20)

1. **No Render shell exists on the free tier.** Confirmed in Render's docs:
   free web services get neither the dashboard Shell tab nor SSH, and
   `preDeployCommand` is likewise paid-only. The Phase 37 plan ("run migrate +
   createsuperuser + populate_java_course by hand in the Render shell") is
   therefore **void**. All bootstrap commands run locally against Neon, which
   is publicly reachable over SSL. `render.yaml` still runs **no** `migrate`.
2. **Instructor bootstrap is a manual `manage.py shell` fix-up**, not new code.
   `createsuperuser` cannot set `first_name`/`last_name` (the User model has
   `REQUIRED_FIELDS = []`) and never sets `is_instructor`, but
   `populate_java_course` looks the instructor up by hardcoded
   `first_name='Cesar', last_name='Villarreal'`. A three-line shell one-liner
   closes the gap. Keeps Phase 38 config-only; the fragility is accepted and
   recorded below.
3. **Local frontend against the prod API.** `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` /
   `FRONTEND_URL` point at `http://localhost:5173` so the click-through is real
   rather than `curl`-only.
4. **`render.yaml` gets three edits**: `SECRET_KEY` becomes
   `generateValue: true` (the key never touches clipboard or chat), the
   "NOT LIVE YET" header is rewritten, and a comment records that migrations run
   from the laptop, not the (nonexistent) shell.
5. **Neon region is checked against Render's `oregon`** before anything is
   created; a cross-country pairing adds ~70 ms to *every* query.
6. **Media is knowingly broken in production this phase** — see Out of scope.

## Out of scope

- **Media / uploads (Phase 39).** Three independent reasons avatars and lesson
  attachments will 404 in production, all accepted and none a Phase 38
  regression: `config/urls.py:36` only serves `MEDIA_URL` when `DEBUG` is true;
  `MEDIA_URL = 'media/'` (`settings.py:158`) is missing its leading slash; and
  Render's free filesystem is ephemeral, so `MEDIA_ROOT` is wiped on every
  deploy, restart, and spin-down. WhiteNoise covers `staticfiles` only.
  Do **not** "fix" any of this here — R2 replaces it wholesale in Phase 39.
- Cloudflare Pages, `frontend/public/_redirects`, the `VITE_API_URL` prod guard,
  django-storages/R2 — all Phase 39.
- OpenTelemetry / Grafana / Sentry `environment=` tags — Phase 40.
- Custom domain, real email provider (Render's free tier also blocks outbound
  SMTP on 25/465/587 — the console backend stays).
- Upgrading off the free instance type. The ~1 min cold start after 15 min idle
  is accepted for now.
- Adding `migrate` to `buildCommand`, or any new management command
  (`bootstrap_instructor`, an `--instructor-email` flag). Explicitly rejected in
  the interview to keep this phase config-only.
- `makemigrations --check` in CI (a real gap — no CI step catches model drift —
  but it is not this phase's job).
- Migrating any local dev-DB data to Neon. Neon starts empty.
- Editing `docker-compose.prod.yml`, `nginx/`, `backend/Dockerfile.prod`
  (Phase 40 marks them superseded). Note `Dockerfile.prod:29` runs
  `collectstatic` with no `SECRET_KEY` and so now trips the Phase 37 guard —
  leave it; nothing in this phase builds that image.

## Backend tasks

No models, no migrations, no Python changes. Three `render.yaml` edits only.

- [x] `render.yaml`: change `SECRET_KEY` from `sync: false` to
      `generateValue: true`. Render mints a strong key in its vault; it is never
      pasted anywhere. Leaves **6** `sync: false` secrets.
      *(Done — `grep -c 'sync: false'` → 6.)*
- [x] `render.yaml`: rewrite the header comment block. Drop "NOT LIVE YET /
      Nothing here has been applied to a Render account" — describe the live
      service instead.
- [x] `render.yaml`: replace the "run by hand in the Render shell" comment with
      the truth — the free tier has no shell; `migrate`, `createsuperuser`, and
      `populate_java_course` are run from a developer machine with
      `DATABASE_URL` pointed at Neon.
- [x] Confirm `makemigrations --check` is still clean and `/verify-stack`
      passes. The diff is YAML-only, so both should be untouched — run them
      anyway before the PR. *(Both confirmed — see Verification below.)*

## Deployment tasks (dashboards + local one-off commands)

Order matters: bootstrap the DB **before** the first Render deploy, so the
service's first boot lands on a schema that already exists.

### A. Neon

- [ ] Check the region of project `ep-falling-frog-avzgk4ed` (db `neondb`).
      If it is not us-west-2 / Oregon-adjacent, decide before proceeding:
      either change `region:` in `render.yaml`, or recreate the Neon project
      near Oregon. Record the decision in the handoff either way.
- [ ] Rotate the Neon password (carried over from Phase 37, still open). Note
      the new connection string **privately** — never in the repo, never in chat.
- [ ] Confirm the connection string ends in `?sslmode=require`.
      `settings.py:114` hardcodes `ssl_require=True`, so a non-SSL URL fails.

### B. Bootstrap the database from this laptop

Run against Neon by overriding `DATABASE_URL` on the existing dev container.
`DEBUG=True` is passed only to skip the Phase 37 `SECRET_KEY`/`ALLOWED_HOSTS`
guard for these CLI calls; it does not touch the deployed service.

- [ ] `docker compose exec -T -e DATABASE_URL="<neon>" -e DEBUG=True backend python manage.py migrate`
      — expect all **31** migrations across 6 apps to apply, including the
      `gamification.0002_seed_badges` data migration.
- [ ] `docker compose exec -it -e DATABASE_URL="<neon>" -e DEBUG=True backend python manage.py createsuperuser`
      — a **real** email and a strong password. Not `@demo.com`.
- [ ] Fix up the superuser so it is a usable instructor **and** matches what
      `populate_java_course` searches for:
      ```
      docker compose exec -e DATABASE_URL="<neon>" -e DEBUG=True backend \
        python manage.py shell -c "
      from accounts.models import User
      u = User.objects.get(email='<your-email>')
      u.first_name, u.last_name = 'Cesar', 'Villarreal'
      u.is_instructor = True
      u.save()
      print(u.email, u.first_name, u.last_name, u.is_instructor, u.is_staff, u.is_superuser)"
      ```
      Without this, the next step prints `Instructor "Cesar Villarreal" not
      found!` and **silently no-ops**.
- [ ] `docker compose exec -e DATABASE_URL="<neon>" -e DEBUG=True backend python manage.py populate_java_course`
      — expect "JAVA101 population complete". **Run this exactly once.** Despite
      its "NON-DESTRUCTIVE" docstring it does
      `course.units.all().delete()` and rebuilds, which cascades away every
      `LessonProgress` / `LessonQuizAttempt` / `QuizAttempt` on JAVA101.
      Non-destructive to *users and other courses* only. Re-running it after
      students exist wipes their progress.
- [ ] **Never run `seed_data` against Neon.** It hardcodes `Admin123!` on six
      pre-verified `@demo.com` accounts, and `--clear` deletes every course
      globally, JAVA101 included.
- [ ] Verify the bootstrap: exactly one user, no `@demo.com` addresses, JAVA101
      present with its units, and the badge catalog seeded.

### C. Render service

- [ ] Create the service via **New → Blueprint** (not "New Web Service") so
      `render.yaml` governs it and `generateValue` actually applies.
- [ ] Fill the 6 `sync: false` secrets at blueprint-apply time:
      | Key | Value |
      |---|---|
      | `DATABASE_URL` | the rotated Neon string, `?sslmode=require` |
      | `ALLOWED_HOSTS` | `stemquest-api.onrender.com` — **bare host, no scheme, no path** |
      | `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` | `https://stemquest-api.onrender.com` — **scheme required** (Django 4+) |
      | `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:5173` — scheme + port, **no trailing slash** |
      | `FRONTEND_URL` | `http://localhost:5173` |
      | `SENTRY_DSN` | leave empty (gated on non-empty; Phase 40) |
- [ ] After the first deploy, check the **actual** hostname Render assigned. If
      `stemquest-api` was taken it will carry a suffix, in which case correct
      `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` and let it redeploy. A wrong
      `ALLOWED_HOSTS` does not crash the boot — it 400s every request, which is
      the failure mode to watch for.
- [ ] Confirm auto-deploy from `main` on `Cesar6060/LMS` is on.
- [ ] Watch the build log: `pip install` then `collectstatic` (expect ~767
      post-processed files). If `collectstatic` is skipped, the first `/admin/`
      hit raises `ValueError: Missing staticfiles manifest entry` —
      `DEBUG=false` selects WhiteNoise's manifest storage.

## Frontend tasks

No committed frontend changes. One throwaway local run, pointed at prod.

- [ ] Start a second Vite dev server against the live API without editing
      `docker-compose.yml` (which hardcodes `VITE_API_URL`):
      ```
      docker compose run --rm -e VITE_API_URL="https://<host>.onrender.com/api" \
        -p 5173:5173 frontend npm run dev -- --host
      ```
      Note the `/api` suffix — `frontend/src/services/api.ts:3` expects the base
      URL to already include it. Whatever port you land on must match
      `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` exactly.

## Verification

The phase is done when all of the following are demonstrated with pasted output.

**Repo (before the deploy work):**
- [x] `/verify-stack` PASS — pytest **354 passed** in 45.90s, `tsc --noEmit`
      **0 errors**, lint **0 errors / 22 warnings** (= baseline). 2026-07-20.
- [x] `makemigrations --check` → "No changes detected".
- [x] `render.yaml` still parses as YAML after the three edits (js-yaml via the
      frontend container; `SECRET_KEY` reads back as `{"generateValue":true}`).
- [ ] CI green on the PR and on the resulting `main` push.

**API over HTTPS:**
- [ ] `curl -si https://<host>.onrender.com/api/health/` → **200**,
      `{"status": "ok"}`.
- [ ] `curl -si 'https://<host>.onrender.com/api/health/?deep=1'` → **200**,
      `{"status": "ok", "database": "ok"}` — this is the proof Neon is wired up.
- [ ] `curl -si http://<host>.onrender.com/api/health/` → **301** to `https://`
      (proves `USE_HTTPS` + `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER` are working behind
      Render's proxy, and that `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` didn't cause a loop).
- [ ] Response carries `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=3600; includeSubDomains`.
- [ ] A JWT login for the superuser returns 200 with tokens; an authenticated
      `GET /api/courses/` lists JAVA101.
- [ ] `curl -si -H 'Host: evil.example.com' https://<host>.onrender.com/api/health/`
      → **400** (`ALLOWED_HOSTS` is actually enforcing).

**Admin + static:**
- [ ] `https://<host>.onrender.com/admin/` renders **with CSS** in a browser —
      the WhiteNoise manifest check. Confirm a hashed filename
      (`base.<hash>.css`) is served 200 as `text/css`, not a 404 or a 500.
- [ ] Superuser login through `/admin/` succeeds — proves `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`
      and the secure-cookie settings work together over HTTPS.

**Data hygiene:**
- [ ] `User.objects.count()` is **1** and no address ends in `@demo.com`.
- [ ] JAVA101 exists with 5 units and ~19 lessons; `Badge.objects.count()`
      matches the catalog.

**Click-through (local frontend → prod API):**
- [ ] Log in as the instructor at `http://localhost:5173`; the dashboard loads.
- [ ] Open JAVA101 → a unit → a lesson in Learning Mode; sections paginate.
- [ ] Register a brand-new student account, enroll in JAVA101, complete one
      lesson, take one quiz — XP awards and the course map updates.
- [ ] Browser console shows **zero** CORS errors and zero mixed-content
      warnings.
- [ ] Confirm avatar/attachment URLs 404 as expected, and log it as *known,
      Phase 39* rather than a regression.

**Free-tier behaviour:**
- [ ] Leave the service idle >15 min, then time the first request. Record the
      cold-start figure in the handoff — it is the input to any later decision
      about paying for Starter.

## Known landmines (carry into the handoff)

- `populate_java_course` is a **one-shot** in production. Second run = every
  JAVA101 student's progress gone.
- `seed_data --clear` deletes all courses globally, not just demo data.
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS` unset ≠ crash: it falls back to `localhost,127.0.0.1` and
  400s all real traffic. Only an *explicitly empty* value trips the guard.
- `DEBUG` / `USE_HTTPS` use decouple's strict bool cast — a stray space or a
  value like `TRUE!` raises at import and the boot fails.
- The DRF Browsable API renderer is still enabled in production (no
  `DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES` is set). Not a Phase 38 blocker; worth a later look.
- `/api/health/?deep=1` echoes the raw DB exception string to unauthenticated
  callers, which can leak host/user details. Consider narrowing in Phase 40.
- LocMem cache is per-process and `render.yaml` runs 2 gunicorn workers, so any
  future cache use will be inconsistent across workers.
